# Solar Wiki App
In this Nano Challenge proposed by the Apple Developer Academy, we needed to develop an application that consumed an API of our choice. So during the process we understood that we would be consuming and organizing data from an API focused on the planets of the solar system and their attributes. 

To add more challenges and functionalities that would add to the quality of the application, we added the implementation of augmented reality (ARKit).
